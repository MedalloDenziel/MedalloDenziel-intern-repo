## Reflection
### 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
* Focus Bear combines most of the usefull features found on other apps. It combines the distraction blocker, to-do list, and the daily routine habit helper into one package.
### 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over     competitors?
* I'd choose Focus Bear since it enforces routine building daily and guides you through it. While it actively block site from being accessed, Focus Bear does let you access blocked websites but it needs to know the reason and for how long which helps when you forget what sites you have blocked.
### 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
* Focus Bear doesn't have a feature that allows me to start session on any device. I can't start a session on my phone to start session on my laptop.
### 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
* As a first time user I find it confusing on setting up my habits. When it's my first time doing this activities to build a habit I find it difficult to follow. It would help if it would be better to have an option to some parts of the routine first then gradually incorporate them in the future.
