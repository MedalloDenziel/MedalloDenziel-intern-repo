# Cyber Security Reflection - Denziel Medallo

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
* I'm always wary about suspicious links in emails or anywhere I can find them, but this isn't always reliable because I might make a mistake. I also try to make my passwords unique and contain more characters and numbers but I always forget them which results in me changing them to something I can easily understand. 
### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
* By not using any features in apps or browsers that allows me to save my password or login automatically. This forces me to remember my password everytime I login. 
### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
* By using a password manager which will generate and encrypts them then save the passwords for me. So that I can have strong and unique passwords on all my accounts and devices.
### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
* From what I understand it's best to disconnect from the internet and scan device for malware and after that, change passwords to stronger ones.
